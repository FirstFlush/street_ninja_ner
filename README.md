# ü•∑ NinjaTag


**NinjaTag** is a Machine Learning Named Entity Recognition (NER) system designed to process messy, short-form SMS messages submitted by users of the Street Ninja app. Its purpose is to extract structured information ‚Äî like the type of resource being requested and the location ‚Äî in order to route requests to the right services within the Street Ninja system.

This project focuses on building a production-quality NER pipeline tailored to the specific challenges of SMS data:

- Short, often ungrammatical or fragmented messages
- Inconsistent capitalization, slang, or spelling
- Real-world location references that are vague, incomplete, or non-standard
- Entities that blend meaning or overlap

Requests with implied qualifiers like safety, accessibility, or language needs


## ‚ú® What It Does

This system is designed to extract 3 key types of entities from user messages:

- **RESOURCE** ‚Äî what the user is asking for (e.g. shelter, wifi, food)
- **LOCATION** ‚Äî where they want it (e.g. intersection, neighborhood, landmark)
- **QUALIFIER** ‚Äî constraints on the request (e.g. ‚Äúfor women only‚Äù, ‚Äúpet-friendly‚Äù)

These entities are later used to route or match requests within the Street Ninja platform.


## üéØ Why This Exists

This is a learning-first, build-second machine learning project.

- I‚Äôm using this project to learn about **annotation**, **NER modeling**, **data cleaning**, and **ML engineering best practices**
- The system is built with **spaCy**, **Label Studio**, and fully manual annotations
- My goal is not just to get good results, but to understand how to build NER systems that are reliable, modular, and extensible
